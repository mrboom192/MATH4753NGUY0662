\title{Optimal Number of Tickets Calculation}
\usage{
ntickets(N, gamma, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{The number of available seats or capacity of the event. Must be a positive integer.}

\item{gamma}{The allowable risk of overbooking. A probability value between 0 and 1.}

\item{p}{The probability that a ticket holder attends the event. A value between 0 and 1.}
}
\value{
A list with the optimal number of tickets to sell for both discrete (\code{nd}) and continuous (\code{nc}) cases.
}
\description{
This function calculates the optimal number of tickets to sell for an event
given the event capacity, risk tolerance (\code{gamma}), and probability of
attendance (\code{p}). It computes both discrete and continuous approximations
and plots the results for comparison.

\examples{
# Example usage of ntickets function:
result <- ntickets(N = 100, gamma = 0.02, p = 0.95)
print(result)
