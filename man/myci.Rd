\title{Confidence Interval for the Mean}
\usage{
myci(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the sample data from which the confidence interval
will be calculated.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length two, representing the lower and upper bounds of the
95\% confidence interval for the mean of the population from which the sample was drawn.
}
\description{
This function calculates a 95\% confidence interval for the population mean (\eqn{\mu})
based on a single sample using a t-distribution. The function takes a numeric vector
as input, computes the sample mean and standard error, and returns the lower and upper
bounds of the confidence interval.
}
\details{
The confidence interval is calculated using the formula:
\deqn{\bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
where \eqn{\bar{x}} is the sample mean, \eqn{t_{\alpha/2, n-1}} is the critical value of
the t-distribution with \eqn{n-1} degrees of freedom, \eqn{s} is the sample standard deviation,
and \eqn{n} is the sample size.

The t-distribution is used to account for the uncertainty in the estimate of the population
standard deviation from the sample.
