\title{Plot and Calculate Normal Curve with Shaded Area}
\usage{
myncurve(mu, sigma, a)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{The mean of the normal distribution.}

\item{sigma}{The standard deviation of the normal distribution.}

\item{a}{The x-value up to which the area under the curve is shaded and the probability is calculated.}
}
\value{
A list containing the mean (mu), standard deviation (sigma), and the probability P(X <= a).
}
\description{
This function plots a normal distribution curve with specified mean and standard deviation,
shades the area under the curve between -âˆž and a given x-value, and calculates the probability
of P(X <= a).
}
\examples{
# Example usage of myncurve function:
myncurve(mu = 0, sigma = 1, a = 1.5)
